Gameplay 
Program manager (the player) sets up PR campaigns to hype up accomplishments. The PR itself is done by Kerbals on staff,
with various degree of competence. Overhype affects credibility of both the kerbal and the agency, which blunts the ability
to accumulate reputation. 

The higher the reputation, the more potent kerbals are upon hiring. Engineers affect the VAB, Scientists, the R&D complex, and 
pilots affect public profile. High profile kerbals will leave the program if the reputation gets too low. Over time, kerbals
also get better at what they do, thus providing an incentive to keep them. Also, their level affects their profile, 
providing an incentive to get them to fly.

Therefore, maximizing reputation allows to accelerate the program, and staff tradeoff need to be balanced. Properly balanced, 
this mechanics implies sustaining a tempo of reputation earnings through incentive. 

Bonus: 5% (level 0), 10% (level 1), 20% (level 2)
Profile: 

Iteration 1
Reputation decays over time with a (kind of) assymptote at 20 reputation (for now)

Iteration 2
Idle kerbals, assumed to be in the spotlight, set the assymptote as a function of their media profile/credibility. They
accumulate hype over time, which sets a upper limit to reputation earnings. At year end, if the earnings are less than
the hype, reputation is affected, and credibility of the staff downgraded.
